Find players with high usage (USG%) and efficient shooting (TS%).,"Based on the provided context, we can identify players with high usage rates (USG%) and efficient shooting (True Shooting Percentage, TS%) by looking at their points per game (PPG) and the context provided. However, the context does not explicitly provide USG% or TS% data. Therefore, we can only infer based on the points per game and total points.

1. **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander** (Oklahoma City Thunder):
   - 2485 total points across 76 games, averaging 32.7 points per game.
   - High usage is inferred from the high PPG, and efficiency can be assumed given the high scoring rate.

2. **Giannis Antetokounmpo** (Milwaukee Bucks):
   - 2485 total points across 67 games, averaging 30.4 points per game.
   - High usage is inferred from the high PPG, and efficiency can be assumed given the high scoring rate.

3. **Nikola Jokić** (Denver Nuggets):
   - 2072 total points across 70 games, averaging 29.6 points per game.
   - High usage is inferred from the high PPG, and efficiency can be assumed given the high scoring rate and high number of assists and rebounds.

These players are likely to have high usage rates and efficient shooting based on their high points per game averages and total points. For precise USG% and TS%, additional data would be required.
